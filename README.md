# NETFLIX_USERBASE
In this project i have worked on data exploration with a  Netflix_Userbase Dataset which was available on kaggle. I have tried to bring valueable insights from data set using SQL. In this project i have tried using basic and intermediate SQL Queries like GROUP BY, ORDER BY and aliasing and aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT.
